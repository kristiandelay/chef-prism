# Useful scripts

+ [sensu-basic-mon](https://github.com/failshell/scripts/blob/master/sensu/sensu-basic-mon) make sure Sensu is functional
+ [rabbitmq-delete-unconsumed-queues.rb](https://github.com/failshell/scripts/blob/master/sensu/rabbitmq-delete-unconsumed-queues.rb) sadly necessary, in some cases, some queues end up with no consumers
